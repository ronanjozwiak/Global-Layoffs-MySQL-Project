These are two related projects using the same dataset, regarding global layoffs from March 2020 to December 2023. 
In the first project, I cleaned the data by removing duplicates, standardizing the data, removing null values and blank values, and removing columns and rows that did not include usable data.
In the second project, I explored the clean data to discover which companies had laid off the greatest number of employees, which had laid off the highest percentage of total employees, and also calculated each of these values for companies where I had incomplete information.
